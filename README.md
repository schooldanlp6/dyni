# dyni
dyni - Dynamic Install. This is a script that scrapes my repos to see installable things. This does auto installs easy. and you can universally use it

## How the repos should work:
dyni is a package manager. but it uses unlike aospac custom repos. And it can run containerzied like aospac with container-graph (WiP)
